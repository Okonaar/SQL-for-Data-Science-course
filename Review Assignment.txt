Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
	SELECT  COUNT(*)
	FROM    [table];

i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

	SELECT  COUNT(DISTINCT(some_key))
	FROM    [table];

i. Business: id = 10000
ii. Hours: business_id = 1562 
iii. Category: business_id = 2643
iv. Attribute: business_id = 1115
v. Review: business_id = 8090
		   user_id = 9581
		   id = 10000
vi. Checkin: business_id = 493
vii. Photo: business_id = 6493
			id = 10000
viii. Tip: business_id = 3979
		   user_id = 537
ix. User: id = 10000
x. Friend: user_id = 11
xi. Elite_years: user_id = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No, they are not.
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT  COUNT(*)  
	FROM    User
	WHERE   id IS NULL OR
	        name IS NULL OR

			yelping_since IS NULL OR
			useful IS NULL OR 
			funny IS NULL OR 
			cool IS NULL OR

4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	SELECT  MIN(column)   -- or MAX(), AVG() 
	FROM    [table];
	
	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:		max:		avg:
		 1           5         3.7082
	 
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars

	+------------------------+--------+--------------+

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
		In fact, after analyzing the ratio of comments (reviews) to fans, I concluded that the degree of dependence between these 
	variables is quite low. I built a graph for a graphical understanding of the situation (I will try to attach to the report) and with 
	an increase in the number of fans, the number of comments not only does not increase, in some places it even decreases. Of course, 
	the connection can be traced, but not strong. In the range of subscribers from 100 to 500, there was a jump in the growth of fans, 
	but only for a while. More data needed.

	Code:

	SELECT      name,
	            fans,
	            review_count
	FROM        user
	ORDER BY    fans DESC;

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

		As a result of the execution of the request I received 3 entries. Yes, they are distributed by hours,
		but this takes into account the fact that the sample of entries is very small. It is difficult to say exactly, 
		judging by these results, but establishments with a rating of "4-5" stars have less working hours per day, 
		regardless of the day of the week.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

		In fact, yes. And no. After executing the request, I received that the business that has a rating
		of "4-5" received 32 reviews, while the second business with the same rating is only 4 reviews.
		The same, low number, received and business with a rating of "2-3" - 6 reviews. Again, depends on the number of entries.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

		Unfortunately not. Although the establishments are in the same city, but they are in no way connected 
		to each other, have different postal codes.

SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT		B.name,
				B.city,
				B.state,
				B.postal_code,
				CASE
					WHEN H.hours LIKE 'Monday%' THEN 'Monday'
					WHEN H.hours LIKE 'Tuesday%' THEN 'Tuesday'
					WHEN H.hours LIKE 'Wednesday%' THEN 'Wednesday'
					WHEN H.hours LIKE 'Thursday%' THEN 'Thursday'
					WHEN H.hours LIKE 'Friday%' THEN 'Friday'
					WHEN H.hours LIKE 'Saturday%' THEN 'Saturday'
					WHEN H.hours LIKE 'Sunday%' THEN 'Sunday'
				END AS [Work Days],
				H.hours,
				C.category,
				CASE 
					WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3'
					WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5'
					ELSE '-'
				END AS rating
	FROM 		business AS B
	INNER JOIN	category AS C ON B.id = C.business_id
	INNER JOIN	hours AS H ON B.id = H.business_id
	WHERE		(B.city = 'Las Vegas'
				AND  C.category = 'Shopping')
				AND ((B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3)
				OR	(B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5))
	GROUP BY	B.stars, [Work Days]
	ORDER BY	[Work Days], rating ASC  

		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

         As a rule, open business have more rating, than closed business.

         AVG(stars)

         3.52039473684 - closed
         3.67900943396 - open

ii. Difference 2:
         
         An open business has more reviews than a closed one. 

         AVG(review_count)

         23.1980263158 - closed
         31.7570754717 - open
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT 		COUNT(DISTINCT(id)),
			AVG(review_count),
			AVG(stars),
			SUM(review_count)
			is_open
FROM 		business
GROUP BY 	is_open

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

		As a type of analysis I chose the following: the analysis of competitors both in the selected industry. 
		Assess and understand what affects business success, how to fix it.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

         For analysis, I chose data such as: business location (coordinates, state, address), number of reviews, 
         reviews themselves, the number of stars and the operating time of a particular business. The main emphasis 
         was placed on user comments, because there we can find accurate first-person information about what people 
         like and what not. Also, for the reliability of comments, we look at who wrote it and how many fans this 
         commentator has. All this, and not only makes it clear how to improve your business, adapt it to the needs 
         of the market.
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
